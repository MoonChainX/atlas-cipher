# Atlas Cipher - Project Summary

## Project Overview

Atlas Cipher is a revolutionary cross-border payment system that implements confidential transactions using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. The system ensures that transaction amounts are encrypted during settlement, protecting commercial privacy between sender and receiver.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **FHE-Encrypted Transactions**
- All transaction amounts are encrypted using FHEVM
- Zero-knowledge proof validation
- Private memo encryption
- Recipient anonymity protection

### 2. **Web3 Wallet Integration**
- RainbowKit integration for multi-wallet support
- Wagmi for Ethereum interactions
- Viem for low-level blockchain operations
- Support for popular wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

### 3. **Smart Contract Architecture**
- `AtlasCipher.sol` - Main contract with FHE encryption
- Payment transaction management
- Settlement record keeping
- User profile and reputation system
- Encrypted balance tracking

### 4. **Modern Frontend**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design with cyber-themed animations

### 5. **Security Features**
- End-to-end encryption for transaction amounts
- Zero-knowledge proofs for validation
- Secure wallet integration
- Encrypted user profiles and balances
